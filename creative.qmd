title: "Creative responses"
---

Based on our recent research on digitalisation of energy infrastructures, we commissioned a series of illustrations to open up conversations about the politics, labour and emotions associated with smart energy innovations.

Our artworks have helped to train professionals about cyber security and data sharing, engage citizens with heat pumps and galvanise critical conversations about hopes and fears regarding innovations.

We have exhibited the artworks during numerous public and academic events. In September 2023, we will showcase the illustrations at the V&A Digital Design Weekend (22-24th Sept, London) and FUTURES Festival (29th Sept, Bristol).

Many thanks to PETRAS, EPSRC Impact Accelerator Account and Bristol Digital Futures Institute for sponsoring the projects. The work was done in a collaboration with Mary Hart, Liz Ormian, Aude Nasr, Oliver Dean, Jordan Collver (artists),; Ruzanna Chitchyan, Joe Bourne, Emma Osborne (researchers); Ofgem, Energy Systems Catapult, Bristol City Council (project partners). Project PI is Ola Michalec.
