    "text": "IoT is expected to play a major part in the ongoing transition of energy systems. With the possibility of new actors, tariffs, appliances and relationships, IoT could disrupt the energy market – whether for the better or worse. The notion of “disruption” should not be taken for granted – IoT’s success relies on software developers’ assumptions as well as regulatory requirements with regards security, privacy and data sharing. What arrangements are “good enough” to make IoT work? What are the social implications of these arrangements? What are the regulatory gaps resulting from development of IoT? How do we facilitate development of responsible innovation where IoT is aligned with policy goals of decarbonisation, affordability and security?\nPrevious research on IoT in energy focuses on appliances, consumers and emerging technologies. So far, there has been little focus on IoT in energy organisations and interactions between them. Without critical social science research on the disruptive powers of IoT to security and privacy of energy markets, there is a risk that energy innovation will not be aligned with public interest. The researchers will deliver reports on the future of current policies like Network and Information Systems Security Regulation and proposed regulations to consumer IoT security, and will engage with stakeholders in the field to inform current initiatives.\n Outputs: COMING SOON!"

    "text": "Research notes by Suheyb Said Based on the chapter by Eckhart, M., & Ekelhart, A. (2019). Digital twins for cyber-physical systems security: State of the art and outlook. Security and Quality in Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering: With Forewords by Robert M. Lee and Tom Gilb, 383-412\n\nIntroduction\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are crucial for Industry 4.0, blending physical and virtual components to automate and intelligently operate various sectors. However, CPSs can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, posing threats to public safety.\nTo address CPS security challenges, researchers explore the concept of digital twins, which are virtual replicas of physical objects, that help monitor, visualize, and predict the state of cyber-physical systems. Digital twins offer promising security-enhancing use cases for CPSs. Digital twins could enhance the security of smart factories by spotting security flaws during the design phase and supporting security testing and intrusion detection throughout the system’s lifecycle. However, creating and maintaining digital twins efficiently remains a significant research challenge due to overhead costs. Despite this the full potential and research challenges of digital twins in information security require further exploration.\n\n\nThe digital twin: origin\nThe concept of digital twins has its origins in NASA’s Apollo program, where a twin of a spacecraft was created for training and mirroring flight conditions based on data from the operational spacecraft. Over time, digital twins have evolved from physical copies to virtual models of systems due to technological advancements in simulations and connectivity.\nThe term “digital twin” was coined by Shafto et al. (2010) and initially focused on mirroring the life of air vehicles. However, in 2013, Lee et al. introduced digital twins to the manufacturing sector, where they simulate physical counterparts based on physical models. This concept expanded to other areas, including health monitoring, systems engineering, and managing various phases of a system’s lifecycle.\nThe concept of digital twins has different interpretations, often leading to confusion among the stakeholders. Key requirements for digital twins include real-time data, integration, and fidelity to accurately mirror physical counterparts. While the adoption of high-fidelity simulations with real-time data integration is envisioned for the future, most of the current digital twins lack these features. Data integration, either from past lifecycles or real-time acquisition, is essential for creating virtual replicas. However, there is no consensus on the minimum level of data integration required. Industry professionals often view digital twins as simulation models of physical objects that may not receive data instantly or continuously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Note\n\n\n\nDigital twin is a virtual replica of a system that accompanies its physical counterpart during phases of its lifecycle, consumes real-time and historical data if required, and has sufficient fidelity to allow the implementation of the desired security measure.\n\n\n\n\nUse Cases of Digital Twins in the Manufacturing Domain\nThe digital twin concept finds various applications in the manufacturing domain throughout the lifecycle of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). In the engineering phase, digital twins are used to efficiently to design, test, and fabricate systems, utilising 2D/3D models and physical simulations. During the operation phase, digital twins monitor the health of CPPSs in real-time, allowing for preventive/proper maintenance and process optimisation. In the end-of-life phase, digital twins retain knowledge about the system’s life for future reuse and assist in the proper disposal of materials. Overall, digital twins enhance efficiency, reduce downtime, and optimise the lifecycle management of CPPSs (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Engineering Life cycle of a system\n\n\n\n\nThe digital thread\nThe digital thread involves linking data throughout various phases of a system’s lifecycle to increase efficiency in development and deployment. It enables an unbroken data link through the lifecycle and can be utilized to generate and provide updates to a digital twin. Semantic interoperability of tools used throughout the lifecycle is essential for implementing the digital thread.\nWhile the digital thread can support digital twins and enhance the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), it also represents an attractive target for attacks, as it contains valuable data. A compromised digital thread could lead to severe consequences, such as manipulated updates that put the digital twin into a malicious state. Therefore, implementing adequate security measures to protect each link within the digital thread is crucial.\n\n\nSecurity Use Cases of Digital Twin\nDigital twins can be utilised during the engineering phase to design more secure cyber-physical systems (CPSs). They can be combined with cyber ranges to simulate attacks and evaluate potential damages, leading to more robust and fault-tolerant CPS designs. Digital twins can also help reduce the attack surface by identifying weak spots and unused network services in the CPS specification. Furthermore, they enable testing security controls layer-by-layer, aiding in the implementation of a defence in depth strategy. Additionally, digital twins can be used to evaluate containment strategies for compromised devices, facilitating incident handling during the operation phase.\n\n1. Intrusion detection\nThe concept of digital twins can be utilised for implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Two papers, namely Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018c) and Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018b), demonstrate how digital twins can be leveraged for this purpose.\nIn Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018c), a knowledge-based intrusion detection system is implemented. It specifies misuse patterns that the system would exhibit upon a compromise. The digital twins are continuously checked for rule violations based on safety and security rules.\nIn Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018b), a state replication approach is introduced, allowing digital twins to virtually mirror the behaviour of the real CPS during operation. This approach enables the implementation of a behaviour-specification-based IDS. The digital twins receive the same inputs as their physical counterparts, and intrusion detection is achieved by comparing their inputs and outputs. This technique generally yields a low false-negative rate and is capable of detecting previously unknown attacks.\n\n\n2. Detecting Hardware/software misconfigurations\nDetecting hardware and software misconfigurations in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) can be achieved using digital twins. Digital twins, which replicate the functionality of real devices, should exhibit similar characteristics to their physical counterparts. Any deviation between the virtual replicas and the actual devices may indicate malicious actions or misconfigurations. For this use case, digital twins are employed to compare the configurations of physical devices with their corresponding virtual replicas. If any manipulation or discrepancy is detected, it can signal a potential security issue or misconfiguration. It’s essential to run the digital twins in an isolated and protected environment to prevent tampering by malicious actors.\n\n\n3. Security Testing\nConducting security tests in operational technology (OT) environments, especially during CPS operation, can be risky and costly. To address this, the use of digital twins has been proposed as a solution. Digital twins allow security tests to be performed virtually on the replicas instead of real systems, ensuring no disruption to live systems and reducing the need for expensive testbeds. By using digital twins, security tests can be carried out both during the operational phase and the engineering phase. In the engineering phase, vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed early in the CPS lifecycle. Moreover, the challenge lies in striking a balance between the fidelity of digital twins and the costs involved, ensuring that security tests yield valuable results while keeping expenses in check. Some approaches, like the one proposed by Bitton et al. (2018 ), focus on developing cost-effective specifications of digital twins to support security tests within a certain budget.\n\n\n4. Privacy\nDamjanovic-Behrendt (2018b) studied how digital twins can be used to protect the privacy of smart car drivers. The work explores automated privacy assessments based on a virtual replica of a smart car that continuously receives real-time data from onboard sensors. An example is given where an insurer offers usage-based insurance using data from digital twins. Machine learning methods are integrated into the digital twins to classify personal data, which is then anonymised before being transferred to the insurer, ensuring customer privacy rights are preserved and GDPR requirements are met. While the focus was on smart cars, the approach could potentially be applied to other types of CPSs, including smart grids, transportation systems, and medical CPSs, offering privacy-enhancing techniques for these domains as well.\n\n\n5. Training\nDigital twins can be used as a platform for system testing and training. Since digital twins exist virtually and operate in isolated environments, they are well-suited for testing new defences before implementation and training personnel to respond to cyber incidents. In combination with a cyber range, attacks can be launched against digital twins for training and testing purposes. The digital-twin framework proposed by Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018c) also supports system testing. Real devices can be interfaced with the framework to test their behaviour. The framework can be used to uncover weaknesses and train information security personnel in implementing effective defences in response to attacks. Data collected during these exercises can be valuable for risk assessments.\n\n\n6. Secure Decommissioning\nWhen CPSs and ICSs (Industrial Control Systems) reach their end-of-life phase, it is crucial to ensure secure decommissioning. Digital twins can assist in this process by helping to properly dispose of materials and answer questions related to media sanitization. They can also aid in ensuring that data security requirements are met during the disposal of the digital thread and the digital twins themselves. Proper archiving and secure closure of the digital twins must be ensured to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches during decommissioning.\n\n\n7. Compliance\nTauber and Schmittner (2018) highlight the significance of monitoring the security and safety of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) during their operational phase. They propose that digital twins can play a crucial role in this process by accurately reflecting the behaviour of CPS throughout their entire lifecycle. By continuously monitoring and documenting security and safety aspects through digital twins, organizations can provide evidence of meeting security standards, such as IEC 62443, and comply with legal requirements. With increasing regulatory requirements for CPS operators, integrating security and legal compliance support into digital twins becomes valuable. This approach allows for better control and oversight of CPS operations, ensuring that they adhere to industry standards and legal obligations, thereby enhancing the overall security and resilience of critical infrastructure."

For decades, inaccessible legacy computing systems have been running critical infrastructures, like power plants, train stations or wastewater facilities. These so-called operational technologies (OTs), traditionally consisted of isolated computers controlling sensors and actuators, often use simple binary logic (e.g. a machine turning on/off depending on a sensed ambient temperature). The proponents of infrastructure modernisation argue that legacy systems are due an upgrade – after all, they remained the same for decades. Connecting critical infrastructures to the Internet and the world of big data would equip practitioners with the possibility of remote operations, predictive maintenance or real-time monitoring of industrial processes. Although this paradigm shift offers interesting prospects, it also brings a novel concern, namely cyber security.\nMoreover, the requirement for cyber security cannot be divorced from safety as the consequences of cyber security attacks in critical infrastructure systems move into the material realm. Cyber security attacks on OTs can lead to explosions, collisions and blackouts.

    "text": "Decarbonising the energy system by 2050 presents multiple dilemmas between national security, affordability, public support, and health. What if we could model these dilemmas and better anticipate sociotechnical impacts of building a new nuclear station, installation of solar panels on every roof, or a change in energy tariffs? Digital twins – advanced virtual representations of social and physical processes and objects – promise to achieve that. However, as digital twins are still in the ‘demonstrator’ stage, many questions arise with regards to data accuracy, security, and, most importantly, ethical foundations of claims made by models which have significant implications for democratic decision-making. ​\nDigital twins, simulations and advanced modelling facilities promise to provide accurate data-driven representations of complex socio-technical entities, for example energy systems (Energy Systems Catapult, 2022). However, we shouldn’t take these possibilities for granted. Social science research on the philosophy of computer modelling and test beds has demonstrated their performative characteristics (i.e., the power of models to produce and influence reality as they lead to political action and scholarly debates; MacKenzie, 2005) as well the risk of instrumentalising the facilities for market gains (Laurent et al., 2021). ​\nWe, therefore, need to understand the kinds of energy futures that are ‘in the making’ thanks to the advancements in DT and simulations. Who are the experts, collaborations, and datasets behind the models? Understanding the socio-technical dimensions of expertise contributing towards representations of energy futures is vital for ensuring the simulated futures and associated political decisions are democratic, equitable and sustainable. ​\nPrevious literature on social studies of modelling investigated smart city test beds or geoengineering experimentation as case studies (Halpern et al. 2013; Stilgoe, 2015). However, the unprecedented level of complexity and intertwinement between social and technical domains calls for a renewed attention toward the promises, challenges, and epistemologies of scientific simulation. ​\n​\nThe recent advancements in computational modelling and open data require a socio-technica inquiry. For example, organisational ethnography (Neyland, 2007) which incorporate field visits, interviews, and shadowing sessions, could sched a light on day to day working practices of collaboration and conflict resolution. Similarly, Focus groups and workshops could be useful for knowledge exchange and agenda-setting purposes. The approach draws on the long tradition of ‘science studies’ (Woolgar and Latour, 1988; Michalec et al., 2021), where the production of scientific and technical knowledge is understood as cultural practice (Seaver, 2017). This means the digital twins’ research agenda is influenced by the political landscape, funding priorities, collaborations mobilised, and enthusiasm generated among the lay publics. As digital twins enter more complex, socio-technical domains, we ought to understand how experts from different social worlds make claims to knowledge, i.e., their assumptions, long term motivations, tools they use.​\nProject 1 : Energy and Democracy in Digital Twins\nProject 2 : Living in a simulation?

    "section": "Digital twin layers in a nutshell",
    "text": "Digital twin layers in a nutshell\nLayer 1 - Data Collection: This layer is like the foundation of the Digital Twin. It collects real-time data from sensors and devices attached to the real-world object. These sensors gather information about its status, performance, and other important aspects.\nLayer 2 - Data Processing: Once the data is collected in Layer 1, it goes to Layer 2 for processing. Here, the collected data is organised, cleaned, and made ready for analysis. This layer ensures that the data is in good shape for the Digital Twin to work with.\nLayer 3 - Model Building: In this layer, a digital model of the real-world object is created. It’s like building a virtual version of the object based on the collected data. This digital model allows us to understand and simulate how the real object behaves under different conditions.\nLayer 4 - Visualization and Interaction: The final layer is like putting the finishing touches on the Digital Twin. It provides a way for users to see and interact with the virtual copy. You can visualize data, run simulations, and make decisions based on the insights gained from the Digital Twin.\n\nSecurity of Digital Twins: attack classification\nThe overall attack surface is broad, with attackers potentially compromising the DT through physical or digital means. Digital attacks are associated with software, networks, and information systems, while physical attacks are related to access to endpoints and communication infrastructures.\nIn this section, security threats are classified and analysed according to the four layers of functionality. Ultimately, security threats impact operational requirements of DT such as availability, integrity, confidentiality, privacy, among the others. For example, if successful, attackers can extract information, exfiltrate sensitive data, or disrupt critical systems. Such attacks can be sophisticated, resembling Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) seen in real-world cases like Stuxnet, BlackEnergy, ExPetr, or GreyEnergy.\n\nDifferent layers and their attacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayer 1\nLayer 2-3\nLayer 4\n\n\n\n\nPrivilege Escalation\nExctraction of private information\nRogue HMIs\n\n\nDenial of Service\nDigital Twins service tampering\nVisualisation tampering\n\n\nPhysical Attack\nMan-in-the-middle attacks\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\nPrivacy leakage\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\nRogue vertical resources\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nLayer 1 attacks\nPrivilege escalation- a security threat where attackers try to gain higher-level access to control systems (admin control). This happens due to weaknesses in security measures or outdated systems. In Digital Twin scenarios, similar attacks could disrupt the system, causing significant deviations in the virtual model.\nDenial of Service (DoS) is an attack where bad actors overwhelm the devices used in the system, causing them to run out of resources and stop working. This disruption affects both the physical operations and the virtual simulations in the Digital Twin. The attackers can use various methods to achieve this, like flooding the system with too much data or selective blocking of important information. They can also coordinate with other malicious devices to create a powerful army of attackers. The goal of such attacks is to disrupt the functionality and communication of the Digital Twin system, which can have severe consequences on decision-making, monitoring, and control processes.\nPhysical Attack - Attackers are physically interacting with the infrastructure needed to produce Digital Twins. Examples of physical attacks can be theft or destruction to the devices used in the digital twin in environment, which can affect how the digital twin system can collect data. Security measures used to prevent this are typically CCTV, Security Alarms and access control (e.g., ID badges).\n\n\nLayer 2-3 attacks (Both layers have similar attacks)\nExtraction of private information - Attackers can steal sensitive data such as system dynamics, configurations, and security credentials. This enables cyber espionage (spying) which improves attack techniques.\nDigital Twins (DT) service tampering - This attack relates to manipulating and tempering with the services of Digital Twins. For example, Digital Twin models can become desynchronised, leading to inconsistencies between the virtual and real-world models as data may be modified, hidden, etc. This can potentially lead to poor decision making from engineering as the digital twin model will be provided false insights.\nMan-in-the-middle attacks: Attackers can intercept and manipulate information flowing between the Digital Twins and other components, which can alter databases, and present misleading information to end users. This can lead to poor decision making.\nPrivacy leakage: Accidental disclosure of information that exposes sensitive details which can happen as Digital Twin servers handle large volumes of private data. It’d important to implement robust security and privacy measures and encrypt sensitive data to prevent this from happening.\nRogue virtual resources- Insiders with privileged access can manipulate the servers hosting digital twin by inserting malicious virtual resources. The goal is so that they can control over a part of the digital twin model.\n\n\nLayer 4 attacks\nRogue HMIs- Insiders with access rights to IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) domains can insert authorised HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces) connected to the digital twins. Through these rogue attackers, other attackers can carry out malicious actions such as modifying data connected to the digital twins.\nVisualization tampering: Attackers can modify digital twin services and can manipulate the final visualisation which can lead to incorrect decision making."

The layers make up the digital twin.\nTo better illustrate, think of a 4 layered cake. All the 4 layers interact with each other to make up the entire cake. This is the same concept in digital twins. The digital twin model has 4 distinct layers with different functionalities."

    "text": "Digital twin layers in a nutshell\nLayer 1 - Data Collection: This layer is like the foundation of the Digital Twin. It collects real-time data from sensors and devices attached to the real-world object. These sensors gather information about its status, performance, and other important aspects.\nLayer 2 - Data Processing: Once the data is collected in Layer 1, it goes to Layer 2 for processing. Here, the collected data is organised, cleaned, and made ready for analysis. This layer ensures that the data is in good shape for the Digital Twin to work with.\nLayer 3 - Model Building: In this layer, a digital model of the real-world object is created. It’s like building a virtual version of the object based on the collected data. This digital model allows us to understand and simulate how the real object behaves under different conditions.\nLayer 4 - Visualization and Interaction: The final layer is like putting the finishing touches on the Digital Twin. It provides a way for users to see and interact with the virtual copy. You can visualize data, run simulations, and make decisions based on the insights gained from the Digital Twin.\n\nSecurity of Digital Twins: attack classification\nThe overall attack surface is broad, with attackers potentially compromising the DT through physical or digital means. Digital attacks are associated with software, networks, and information systems, while physical attacks are related to access to endpoints and communication infrastructures.\nIn this section, security threats are classified and analysed according to the four layers of functionality. Ultimately, security threats impact operational requirements of DT such as availability, integrity, confidentiality, privacy, among the others. For example, if successful, attackers can extract information, exfiltrate sensitive data, or disrupt critical systems. Such attacks can be sophisticated, resembling Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) seen in real-world cases like Stuxnet, BlackEnergy, ExPetr, or GreyEnergy.\n\nDemonstration of pipe table syntax\n\n\nLayer 1\nLeyer 2-3\nLayer 4\n\n\n\n\n1\n12\n12\n\n\n123\n123\n123\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\nLayer 1 attacks\nPrivilege escalation- a security threat where attackers try to gain higher-level access to control systems (admin control). This happens due to weaknesses in security measures or outdated systems. In Digital Twin scenarios, similar attacks could disrupt the system, causing significant deviations in the virtual model.\nDenial of Service (DoS) is an attack where bad actors overwhelm the devices used in the system, causing them to run out of resources and stop working. This disruption affects both the physical operations and the virtual simulations in the Digital Twin. The attackers can use various methods to achieve this, like flooding the system with too much data or selective blocking of important information. They can also coordinate with other malicious devices to create a powerful army of attackers. The goal of such attacks is to disrupt the functionality and communication of the Digital Twin system, which can have severe consequences on decision-making, monitoring, and control processes.\nPhysical Attack - Attackers are physically interacting with the infrastructure needed to produce Digital Twins. Examples of physical attacks can be theft or destruction to the devices used in the digital twin in environment, which can affect how the digital twin system can collect data. Security measures used to prevent this are typically CCTV, Security Alarms and access control (e.g., ID badges).\n\n\nLayer 2-3 attacks (Both layers have similar attacks)\nExtraction of private information - Attackers can steal sensitive data such as system dynamics, configurations, and security credentials. This enables cyber espionage (spying) which improves attack techniques.\nDigital Twins (DT) service tampering - This attack relates to manipulating and tempering with the services of Digital Twins. For example, Digital Twin models can become desynchronised, leading to inconsistencies between the virtual and real-world models as data may be modified, hidden, etc. This can potentially lead to poor decision making from engineering as the digital twin model will be provided false insights.\nMan-in-the-middle attacks: Attackers can intercept and manipulate information flowing between the Digital Twins and other components, which can alter databases, and present misleading information to end users. This can lead to poor decision making.\nPrivacy leakage: Accidental disclosure of information that exposes sensitive details which can happen as Digital Twin servers handle large volumes of private data. It’d important to implement robust security and privacy measures and encrypt sensitive data to prevent this from happening.\nRogue virtual resources- Insiders with privileged access can manipulate the servers hosting digital twin by inserting malicious virtual resources. The goal is so that they can control over a part of the digital twin model.\n\n\nLayer 4 attacks\nRogue HMIs- Insiders with access rights to IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) domains can insert authorised HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces) connected to the digital twins. Through these rogue attackers, other attackers can carry out malicious actions such as modifying data connected to the digital twins.\nVisualization tampering: Attackers can modify digital twin services and can manipulate the final visualisation which can lead to incorrect decision making."

    "text": "The concept of digital twins can be utilised for implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Two papers, namely Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018c) and Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018b), demonstrate how digital twins can be leveraged for this purpose.\nIn Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018c), a knowledge-based intrusion detection system is implemented. It specifies misuse patterns that the system would exhibit upon a compromise. The digital twins are continuously checked for rule violations based on safety and security rules.\nIn Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018b), a state replication approach is introduced, allowing digital twins to virtually mirror the behaviour of the real CPS during operation. This approach enables the implementation of a behaviour-specification-based IDS. The digital twins receive the same inputs as their physical counterparts, and intrusion detection is achieved by comparing their inputs and outputs. This technique generally yields a low false-negative rate and is capable of detecting previously unknown attacks."

The work explores automated privacy assessments based on a virtual replica of a smart car that continuously receives real-time data from onboard sensors. An example is given where an insurer offers usage-based insurance using data from digital twins. Machine learning methods are integrated into the digital twins to classify personal data, which is then anonymised before being transferred to the insurer, ensuring customer privacy rights are preserved and GDPR requirements are met.\nWhile the focus was on smart cars, the approach could potentially be applied to other types of CPSs, including smart grids, transportation systems, and medical CPSs, offering privacy-enhancing techniques for these domains as well."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since 2018, the European Union member states and the UK have been working on implementing the Network and Information Systems Security (NIS) Directive. The literature analysing the framing of NIS (Michels and Walden, 2018, and Wallis and Johnson, 2020) points at two main policy concerns: (i) the operators will fail to share or disclose information about cybersecurity measures and breaches and, as a result,  (ii) we will lack the understanding of co-dependencies (i.e. how security issues impact other areas of business). Our recent work through RITICS on NIS implementation (Michalec et al, 2020 and 2021) confirms that both the goals of NIS and OT security issues are poorly understood outside of the narrow circle of experts. In particular, the Indicators of Good Practice (IGP) need further refining to better illustrate the progress in maturity (ibid.). \nWe, therefore, need to build a community of both cyber experts and non-technical business leaders to enable translation between security and operational concerns and, as a result, make better decisions about cyber security in its broader organisational context. This project will draw a roadmap for an improved version of IGPs and cyber maturity assessments, suggesting a range of approaches inspired from ‘agile’ (NCSC, 2017) and ‘anticipatory’ (Carr and Lesniewska, 2020) regulation paradigms.  COI will test them in the future iterations of NIS and communicating training needs for the Operators of Essential Services.\n Outputs: COMING SOON!"

    "text": "Conducting security tests in operational technology (OT) environments, especially during CPS operation, can be risky and costly. To address this, the use of digital twins has been proposed as a solution. Digital twins allow security tests to be performed virtually on the replicas instead of real systems, ensuring no disruption to live systems and reducing the need for expensive testbeds.\nBy using digital twins, security tests can be carried out both during the operational phase and the engineering phase. In the engineering phase, vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed early in the CPS lifecycle. Moreover, the challenge lies in striking a balance between the fidelity of digital twins and the costs involved, ensuring that security tests yield valuable results while keeping expenses in check. Some approaches, like the one proposed by Bitton et al. (2018 ), focus on developing cost-effective specifications of digital twins to support security tests within a certain budget."

In combination with a cyber range, attacks can be launched against digital twins for training and testing purposes.\nThe digital-twin framework proposed by Eckhart and Ekelhart (2018c) also supports system testing. Real devices can be interfaced with the framework to test their behaviour. The framework can be used to uncover weaknesses and train information security personnel in implementing effective defences in response to attacks. Data collected during these exercises can be valuable for risk assessments."
