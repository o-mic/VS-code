title: "Detecting Hardware/Software misconfigurations"
---

Detecting hardware and software misconfigurations in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) can be achieved using digital twins. Digital twins, which replicate the functionality of real devices, should exhibit similar characteristics to their physical counterparts. Any deviation between the virtual replicas and the actual devices may indicate malicious actions or misconfigurations.
For this use case, digital twins are employed to compare the configurations of physical devices with their corresponding virtual replicas. If any manipulation or discrepancy is detected, it can signal a potential security issue or misconfiguration.
Itâ€™s essential to run the digital twins in an isolated and protected environment to prevent tampering by malicious actors.
